<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>As of 12<sup>th</sup> July 2021, more than 186,000,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported across the world, with more than 4,030,000 deaths <span class="citation">(1)</span>.</p>
<p>This weekly report presents forecasts of the <em>reported</em> number of deaths in the week ahead for 65 countries with active transmission. We also present similar results for states/territories of the United States of America with ongoing transmission.</p>
<p>The accuracy of these forecasts vary with the quality of surveillance and reporting in each country. We use the reported number of deaths due to COVID-19 to make these short-term forecasts as these are likely more reliable and stable over time than reported cases. In countries with poor reporting of deaths, these forecasts will likely represent an under-estimate while the forecasts for countries with few deaths might be unreliable.</p>
<p>Note that the results presented in this report do not explicitly model the various interventions and control efforts put in place by countries. Our estimates of transmissibility reflect the epidemiological situation at the time of the infection of COVID-19 fatalities. Therefore, the impact of controls on estimated transmissibility will be quantifiable with a delay between transmission and death.</p>
<p>For short-term forecasts in low-and-middle-income countries using models explicitly accounting for interventions, see <a href="https://mrc-ide.github.io/global-lmic-reports">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="figs/epicurve_pline.png" width="1050" /> <em>Figure 1.</em> (A) The reported number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Africa, Asia, Europe, North &amp; Central America, and South America. (B) The number of countries with active transmission (at least 100 deaths reported, and at least <em>ten</em> deaths observed in each of the past two weeks) in Africa, Asia, Europe, North &amp; Central America, and South America.</p>
</div>
<div id="objectives-and-caveats" class="section level1">
<h1>Objectives and Caveats</h1>
<p>The <strong>main</strong> objective in this report is to produce forecasts of the number of deaths in the week ahead for each country with active transmission.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We define a country as having active transmission if at least 100 deaths have been reported in a country so far, and at least <em>ten</em> deaths were observed in the country in each of the past two weeks. For the week starting 12<sup>th</sup> July 2021, the number of countries/regions included based on these thresholds is 65.</p></li>
<li><p>We forecast the number of potential deaths as the reporting of deaths is likely to be more reliable and stable over time than the reporting of cases.</p></li>
<li><p>As we are forecasting deaths, the latest estimates of transmissibility reflect the epidemiological situation at the time of the infection of COVID-19 fatalities. Therefore, the impact of controls on estimated transmissibility will be quantifiable with a delay between transmission and death.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>secondary</strong> objective of this report is to analyse case ascertainment per country. As well as forecasting ahead, we use the number of reported deaths and of cases reported with a delay (delay from reporting to deaths, see Case Ascertainment method) to analyse the reporting trends per country. If the reporting of cases and deaths were perfect, and the delay between reporting and death is known, the ratio of deaths to delayed cases would equal the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR).</p>
<p>In this analysis, key assumptions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mean underlying CFR is 1.38% (95% Credible Interval (1.23 - 1.53)) <span class="citation">(2)</span>,</li>
<li>The delay from a case being reported to death follows a gamma distribution with mean 10 days, and standard deviation 2 days.</li>
<li>All deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported in each country.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>We define a country to have active transmission if</p>
<ul>
<li>at least 100 deaths have been observed in the country so far; and</li>
<li>at least ten deaths were observed in the country in the last two consecutive weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>We intend to produce forecasts every week, for the week ahead. Ensemble forecasts are produced from the outputs of three different models. We assume a gamma distributed serial interval with mean 6.48 days and standard deviation of 3.83 days following <span class="citation">(3)</span>.</p>
<div id="model-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Model 1</h2>
<p>The approach estimates the current reproduction number (the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infected individual, <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span>) and to use that to forecast future incidence of death. The current reproduction number is estimated assuming constant transmissibility during a chosen time-window (here, one week).</p>
<p><strong>Estimating current transmissibility</strong></p>
<p>Here we relied on a well-established and simple method <span class="citation">(4)</span> that assumed the daily incidence, I<sub>t</sub> (here representing deaths), could be approximated with a Poisson process following the renewal equation <span class="citation">(5)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I_t \sim Pois\left( R_t \sum_{s=0}^tI_{t-s}w_s\right)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> is the instantaneous reproduction number and <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is the serial interval distribution. From this a likelihood of the data given a set of model parameters can be calculated, as well the posterior distribution of <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> given previous observations of incidence and knowledge of the serial interval <span class="citation">(6)</span>.</p>
<p>We used this approach to estimate <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> over three alternative time-windows defined by assuming a constant <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> for 10 days prior to the most recent data-point. We made no assumptions regarding the epidemiological situation and transmissibility prior to each time-window. Therefore, no data prior to the time-window were used to estimate <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span>, and instead we jointly estimated <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> as well as back-calculated the incidence before the time-window. Specifically, we jointly estimated the <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> and the incidence level 100 days before the time-widow. Past incidence was then calculated using the known relationship between the serial interval, growth rate and reproduction number. The joint posterior distribution of <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> and the early epidemic curve (from which forecasts will be generated) were inferred using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.</p>
<p>The model has the advantage of being robust to changes in reporting before the time-window used for inference.</p>
<p><strong>Forward projections</strong></p>
<p>We used the renewal equation <span class="citation">(5)</span> to project the incidence forward, given a back-calculated early incidence curve, an estimated reproduction number, and the observed incidence over the calibration period. We sampled sets of back-calculated early incidence curves and reproduction numbers from the posterior distribution obtained in the estimation process. For each of these sets, we simulated stochastic realisations of the renewal equation from the end of the calibration period leading to projected incidence trajectories.</p>
<p>Projections were made on a 7-day horizon. The transmissibility is assumed to remain constant over this time period. If transmissibility were to decrease as a result of control interventions and/or changes in behaviour over this time period, we would predict fewer deaths; similarly, if transmissibility were to increase over this time period, we would predict more deaths We limited our projection to 7 days only as assuming constant transmissibility over longer time horizons seemed unrealistic in light of the different interventions implemented by different countries and potential voluntary behaviour changes.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Model 2</h2>
<p><strong>Estimating current transmissibility</strong></p>
<p>The standard approach to inferring the effective reproduction number at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span>, from an incidence curve (with cases at t denoted I<sub>t</sub>) is provided by <span class="citation">(6)</span>. This method assumes that <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> is constant over a window back in time of size <em>k</em> units (e.g. days or weeks) and uses the part of the incidence curve contained in this window to estimate <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span>. However, estimates of <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> can depend strongly on the width of the time-window used for estimation. Thus mis-specified time-windows can bias our inference. In <span class="citation">(7)</span> we use information theory to extend the approach of Cori et al. to optimise the choice of the time-window and refine estimates of <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span>. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We integrate over the entire posterior distribution of <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span>, to obtain the posterior predictive distribution of incidence at time t+1 as P(I<sub>t+1</sub> | I<sub>1</sub><sup>t</sup>) with I<sub>1</sub><sup>t</sup> as the incidence curve up to t. For a gamma posterior distribution over <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> this is analytic and negative binomial (<span class="citation">(7)</span> for exact formulae).</p></li>
<li><p>We compute this distribution sequentially and causally across the existing incidence curve and then evaluate every observed case-count according to this posterior predictive distribution. For example at t = 5, we pick the true incidence value I<sub>5</sub>* and evaluate the probability of seeing this value under the predictive distribution i.e. P(I<sub>5</sub> = I<sub>5</sub>* | I<sub>1</sub><sup>4</sup>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This allows us to construct the accumulated predictive error (APE) under some window length <em>k</em> and under a given generation time distribution as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{AP}E_{k} = \sum_{t = 0}^{T - 1}{- \log{P\left( I_{t + 1} = I_{t + 1}^{*}\  \right|\ I_{t - k + 1}^{t})\ \ }}\]</span></p>
<p>The optimal window length <em>k*</em> is then <span class="math inline">\(k^{*} = \arg{\min_{k}{\text{AP}E_{k}}}\)</span>. Here <em>T</em> is the last time point in the existing incidence curve.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Projections</strong></p>
<p>Forward projections are made assuming that the transmissibility remains unchanged over the projection horizon and same as the transmissibility in the last time-window. The projections are made using the standard branching process model using a Poisson offspring distribution.</p>

<div id="model-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Model 3</h2>
<p><em>Objectives</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Estimate trends in case ascertainment and the ratio of deaths to reported cases.</li>
<li>Use these to estimate the true size of the epidemic.</li>
<li>Use these to forecast the number of deaths in the coming week.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Assumptions</em></p>
<p>We assume</p>
<ul>
<li>that deaths due to COVID-19 are perfectly reported;</li>
<li>a known distribution for delay from report to death (gamma distribution with mean 10 days and standard deviation 2 days); and,</li>
<li>a known distribution for CFR <span class="citation">(2)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(D_{i, t}\)</span> be the number of deaths in location <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(I_{i, t}^r\)</span> be the reported number of cases in location <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I_{i, t}^{true}\)</span> be the true number of cases. We assume that the reporting to death delay <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is distributed according to a gamma distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. That is,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\delta \sim \Gamma(\mu, \sigma).\]</span></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(r_{i, t}\)</span> be the ratio of deaths to reported cases in location <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. We assume that deaths are distributed according to a Binomial distribution thus: <span class="math display">\[
D_{i, t} \sim Binom\left( \int\limits_0^{\infty}{\Gamma(x \mid \mu,
\sigma)I_{i, t - x}^{r}dx} , r_{i, \mu}\right).
\]</span></p>
<p>This allows us to obtain a posterior distribution for <span class="math inline">\(r_{i, t}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Case ascertainment is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \rho_{i, t} = \frac{CFR}{r_{i, t}}.\]</span></p>
<p>Thus a posterior distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{i, t}\)</span> can be obtained using the posterior distribution for <span class="math inline">\(r_{i, t}\)</span> and the posterior distribution for CFR.</p>
<p>Combining the CFR and the case ascertainment, we can estimate the true number of cases in the epidemic at any point.</p>
<p>For the period over which we have information on deaths i.e., up to time <span class="math inline">\(t - \mu\)</span>, we use the posterior distribution of CFR to obtain <span class="math inline">\(I_{i, t}^{true}\)</span>. The true number of cases in a location <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the sum cases that did not die and the number of deaths. <span class="math display">\[
I_{i, t}^{true} \sim D_{i, t - \mu} + NBin(D_{i, t - \mu}, CFR).
\]</span></p>
<p>In this formulation, the negative binomial is parameterised as <span class="math inline">\(NBin(n, p)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of failure (i.e. death), and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the probability of observing a failure.</p>
<p>For the period over which we do not have information on deaths i.e., after time <span class="math inline">\(t - \mu\)</span>, we use the posterior distribution of case ascertainment to obtain</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I_{i, t}^{true} \sim I_{i, t}^{r} + NBin(I_{i, t}^{r}, \rho_{i,
t}).
\]</span></p>
<p>To obtain forecast of deaths, we rely on reported cases to obtain <span class="math inline">\(\int\limits_0^{\infty}{\Gamma(x \mid \mu,\sigma)I_{i, t - x}^{r}dx}\)</span>. As cases reported in the coming week may die within the same week ( i.e. for <span class="math inline">\(x \in \{0,7\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma(x \mid \mu,\sigma) &gt; 0\)</span>), we estimate new reporting cases in the coming week by sampling from a Gamma distribution with mean and standard deviation estimated from the number of observed cases in the last week.</p>
<p>While this assumes no growth or decline in the coming week, this baseline assumption is justifiable as a null-hypothesis scenario as it does not influence our results dramatically given the contribution to deaths due to those being very small (i.e. less than 2%).</p>
<p>We therefore obtain the forecasted number of deaths as: <span class="math display">\[
D_{i, t} \sim Binom\left( \int\limits_0^{\infty}{\Gamma(x \mid \mu,
\sigma)I_{i, t - x}^{r}dx} , r_{i, \mu}\right).
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(r_{i, \mu}\)</span> is the estimated ratio of deaths to reported cases for the last week of data, and <span class="math inline">\(\int\limits_0^{\infty}{\Gamma(x \mid \mu,\sigma)I_{i, t - x}^{r}dx}\)</span> relies on observed reported cases up to the last day with available and estimated reported cases as described above.</p>

<h2>References</h2>
<p>The forecasts produced use the reported daily counts of deaths per country available on the WHO website: <a href="https://covid19.who.int" class="uri">https://covid19.who.int</a></p>
<p><em>Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some countries have been excluded from the analysis despite meeting the threshold because the number of deaths per day did not allow reliable inference.</p></li>
<li><p>Some US states have been excluded from the analysis despite meeting the threshold because they are not reporting data on a daily basis.</p></li>
<li><p>The projections for the USA at the national level are made independently of the projections made at the state level (sub-national analysis for the USA). Therefore, the sum of projected deaths for the states from the sub-national analysis may not correspond to the projected deaths at the national level.</p></li>
